We often play games as a family, which invariably leads to some, ahem,
*discussions* about the exact rules of the game. Or we simply forget the
rules of a game.

This repo will archive the rules to some games that we enjoy playing at
home.

### Object of The Game

To be the first player to play all the tiles from your rack by forming
them into sets (runs and/or groups).

A **group** is a set of either three or four tiles of the same number in
different colors.

A **run** is a set of three or more consecutive numbers all in the same
color. The number 1 is always played as the lowest number, it cannot
follow the number 13.
